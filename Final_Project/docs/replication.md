# Replication Guide

**Status:** 🚧 In Progress - Will be completed in Task 03 (Phase 0)

This guide will document the complete workflow for reproducing all analysis, model training, and visualizations from scratch.

## Planned Sections

1. **Prerequisites**
   - System requirements
   - Software dependencies
   - Hardware requirements (GPU for training)

2. **Environment Setup**
   - Cloning the repository
   - Running setup.sh
   - Activating virtual environment
   - Verifying installation

3. **Data Analysis**
   - Multi-label statistics calculation
   - Per-emotion F1 score analysis
   - Expected outputs and interpretation

4. **Model Training**
   - Training in Google Colab
   - Hyperparameter configuration
   - Saving model checkpoints
   - Expected performance metrics

5. **Figure Generation**
   - Class distribution visualization
   - Per-emotion performance plots
   - Output locations and formats

6. **Troubleshooting**
   - Common errors and solutions
   - Dataset download issues
   - Dependency conflicts
   - GPU/CUDA problems
